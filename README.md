## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript (for form validation)
- Git for version control
- GitHub Pages for deployment

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice building a fully responsive layout from scratch using Flexbox and media queries. I also got more comfortable handling form validation logic in JavaScript, including regex testing for proper email formatting and dynamic error messaging.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue improving on accessibility and enhancing the visual polish of forms, particularly in mobile contexts. I also want to get more comfortable with CSS Grid and potentially explore adding animations to improve user feedback.
